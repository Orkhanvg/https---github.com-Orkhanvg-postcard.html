 <h1 div class="readmore__title"> Why is the Amazon important?</h1>
 <p class="readmore__text"></p>
 More than 30 million people, including 350 indigenous and ethnic groups, live in the Amazon and depend on nature for agriculture,
  clothing, and traditional medicines. There is also a clear link between the health of the Amazon and the health of the planet.
   The rain forests, which contain 90 billion to 140 billion metric tons of carbon, help stabilize local and global climate. 
   The Amazon also pumps about 7 trillion tons of water per year into the atmosphere,
    and its forests recycle 50%-75% of annual rainfall back into the atmosphere.

    Climate. While the climate is humid tropical (Af) with warm temperatures and rain falling year round, 
    the forest region is far from uniform in precipitation amounts and season of maximum rainfall.
    Annual precipitation totals vary from 59-118 inches, increasing from east to west. 
    The ITCZ draws moisture far inland from the Atlantic Ocean; its latitudinal shifts influence the timing of the precipitation maximum,
    with the rainiest months occurring when the ITCZ is overhead and the driest when it most distant. The highest amounts occur in the west, 
    where the Andes cause orographic uplift.

    Home to more than a thousand different species of birds like hummingbirds, channel-billed toucans,
     hoatzins and macaws, the Amazon is one of the most diverse areas for birds in the world. Macaws,
      an icon of the Amazon, are highly intelligent and social, living in flocks of 10 to 30 birds. 
      They mate for life and can live up to 60 years. Some species can even mimic human speech. 
      But macaws are under threat from deforestation and the illegal pet trade.
